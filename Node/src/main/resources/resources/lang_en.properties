datasetdetail.epd.unit.meanValue = Mean value of this unit in relationship to the reference unit of this Unit group (see field "Reference unit" in the "Quantitative reference" section). [Notes and Examples\: This vale is i.e. the linear conversion factor for this unit. E.g., if the Unit group would be "Units of mass" and the selected reference unit "kg", then the value stated here for an additional unit "g" would be 0.001, as 1 g is 0.001 times 1 kg. It is recommended to report only significant digits of the value.]

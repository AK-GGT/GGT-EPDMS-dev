About the final implementation:
	*The test needs a running instance of the soda4lca
	*The database should drop and recreate, then start the server on the url defined in Main.java site variable 
		(startup the server could take a long time, because of the migration of the database)
	*The server could run on a different machine, just adjust the url and don't forget to drop the SQL before every run
	*Sometimes simply the UI too slow or Selenium fails because of its error, so if the test fails, maybe it should run again and only report problem 
		if it fails multiple time on the same place/with the same error.

Missing tests, possible future development:
	*all the Network menu (New Node, Manage Node, Registries, About this Node) test missing
	*test the rights correctly, because right now only read, import and export rights are tested. Other rights haven't even implemented in the
		Service API yet.
	*Save the database to file after each testcase, so it would be possible, to load it from there and run any test anytime. Because right now the test should run 
		in a specified order, starting with an empty database
	*test the presence of buttons on the admin main site: http://localhost:8080/Node/admin/index.xhtml (all test uses the upper menu)
	*maybe import some data to an other datastock and test if it's available from a different one

	
Errors to handle:
	*when running the whole testsuite T016ConfigurationTest fails with a strange error: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsINativeMouse.click]"  nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: file:///C:/Users/uzdkm/AppData/Local/Temp/anonymous2900692300178494497webdriver-profile/extensions/fxdriver@googlecode.com/components/command_processor.js :: WebElement.clickElement :: line 10257"  data: no](..)
		but if I run the test alone, it runs fine. So possible reason: previous test is Export, and saving file automatically cause this error.
		More: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=6420
		Possible solution: make the export test the last test (with changing the priority annotation)
	

Should be nice to solve otherwise:
	T030ManageDataSetsTest.manageSomething(..): There is an issue with selenium and checkbox-es: it seems to be click on it and check it, but it doesn't check it correctly
		so the JavaScript doesn't get triggered, the Delete button doesn't get enabled so we send 2 TAB keys and a SPACE, which are checking the second checkbox. It's working
		but could be written more elegant
	
Discovered problems and suggestions with the Service API
	Login: Using this method: ILCDNetworkClient ilcdnc = new ILCDNetworkClient( Main.site + "resource/", "admin", "default" ); doesn't throw an exception or an error 
		if user/password was wrong.
	de.fzk.iai.ilcd.service.client.impl.ILCDNetworkClient.putDataSetAsStream doesn't throw an exception if the user doesn't has the rights
